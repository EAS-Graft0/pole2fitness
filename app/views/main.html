      We are a pole studio based in the Planet Fitness gym in Aberbargoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We run various classes throughout the week from beginners to tricks. We also host 1 off special classes including heels and sexy pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are fun and friendly and we welcome people of abilities. Pole is for everyone, any shape, size or gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great way to get fit whilst having fun. You don't even realize you are exercising! You will learn new moves every week. Pole is a great way to make friends and boost your self confidence.

      I have been poling for just over 5 years and I got hooked from the first class I went to and I haven't stopped since.

      With pole you are always learning and it never ever gets boring. Over the years I have appeared in tv commercials and been a headline act in a ladies night where I demonstrated my pole skills and got the audience involved.
